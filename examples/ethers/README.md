# CubeSigner TypeScript SDK: ethers.js Example

This example shows how the CubeSigner TypeScript SDK can be used to sign
transactions on EVM-based chains with ethers.js. Specifically, the example
shows how to sign and send a simple value transaction from one account to
another.

## Running the Example

To run the example, you need to first create a key and add it to a role like we
did in the [top-level README](../../README.md). After you do this, generate a
session token for the role; you can either save the token (`cs token create ... --save`)
or export as base64:

```bash
export CUBE_SIGNER_TOKEN=$(cs token create ... --output base64)
```

Then, set the source and destination addresses:

```bash
export FROM_ADDRESS=0x... # this is your secp key material id
export TO_ADDRESS=0x... # the recipient
```

For this example to work you need to have some funds in your account.

By default, the example runs on Ethereum Goerli testnet (using Ankr as the RPC
provider). You can, of course, change this to other chains (e.g.,
the Avalanche Fuji C-Chain testnet).
