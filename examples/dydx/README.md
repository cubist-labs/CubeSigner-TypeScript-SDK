This example shows how to use CubeSigner on dYdX v3 (signing with both SECP and
STARK keys in hardware) from creating a user account to getting dYdX API keys
and creating market orders.

Note: this example pulls in dYdX SDK libraries which pull in third-party
dependencies that are out of date (and you might not want in production).
